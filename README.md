# Python to Java Code Translation Using GPT-4

This project explores the capabilities of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) developed by OpenAI, in translating Python code into Java. The aim is to assess the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of GPT-4 in understanding and converting Python syntax and idioms into their Java equivalents, while maintaining the logic and functionality of the original code.

## Overview

The project involves a series of experiments designed to evaluate GPT-4's translation capabilities. These experiments range from basic syntax translation to more complex tasks involving code optimization and handling Python-specific features. 

### Key Objectives

- To evaluate the syntactic accuracy of the Python to Java code translation by GPT-4.
- To assess the functional equivalence of the translated Java code against the original Python code.
- To analyze the efficiency of GPT-4 in optimizing the translated code for Java's operational characteristics.
- To explore the challenges and limitations faced by GPT-4 in translating complex Python features and libraries.
